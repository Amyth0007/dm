10) Implement Hierarchical Clustering using WEKA  tool,


Instructions : Use knowledge
flow environment. Describe the use of each component used also discuss the
clustering results


Steps: 

1. Open weka and select knowledge flow.

2. Drag and drop Arff loader from Data sources tab.

3. Drag and drop Training set maker and Test set maker from
Evaluation tab.

4. Drag and drop Hierarchical cluster from Clusters tab.

5. Drag and drop Cluster Performance Evaluator from
Evaluation tab.

6. Finally drag and drop Test viewer from Visualization tab.

7. Now pass dataset from arff loader to training set and test
set maker further to hierarchical

cluster for clustering.

8. Next batch cluster Hierarchical cluster for cluster
performance evaluation

9. Pass text from Cluster performance evaluator to Text
viewer in order to view result in

text format.

10. Configure arff loader by selecting weathernumeric.arff
and start loading.

11. For result right click on Text viewer and select Show
result, the result will be displayed.
